# Assignment 1

1. K-Neareast Neighbor
2. Linear classifiers: SVM, Softmax
3. Two-layer neural network
4. Image features


## Goals
- Understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)

- Understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning.

- Develop proficiency in writing efficient vectorized code with numpy

- Implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier

- Implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier

- Implement and apply a Softmax classifier

- Implement and apply a Two layer neural network classifier

- Understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers

- Get a basic understanding of performance improvements from using higher-level representations as opposed to raw pixels, e.g. color histograms, Histogram of Gradient (HOG) features, etc.
